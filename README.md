# PyVigenere - Greg Soares
Project: Vigenere Cipher implementation in Python - Beginner Project

Objective:

  Implement an encryption function of cigenere cipher. Hard coded key with a text file as plaintext input.
  The cipher shall only encrypt alphabetic characters("A-Za-z").
  -- For simplification the sample2_modified.txt file has spaces taken out --
  
  All are converted to uppercase letters for easier understanding of the cipher method.
